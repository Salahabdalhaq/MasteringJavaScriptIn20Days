**Scope:**

Scope in programming refers to the context in which variables are defined and accessed. It determines where a variable can be accessed and where it cannot. Understanding scope helps in managing variable access and preventing unintended conflicts.

```javascript
var teacher = "salah";

function otherClass() {
  teacher = "ahmad";
  topic = "math";
  console.log("FFF");
}

teacher; // "salah"

otherClass(); // Logs "FFF"

teacher; // "ahmad"
topic; // "math"
```

The variable `teacher` is initially set to "salah". The function `otherClass` updates the `teacher` variable to "ahmad" and creates a global variable `topic` with the value "math". When the function is invoked, "FFF" is logged to the console. After the function call, `teacher` is "ahmad", and `topic` is "math".

Adding `"use strict"` enforces strict mode, catching common coding mistakes:

```javascript
"use strict"
var teacher = "salah";

function otherClass() {
  teacher = "ahmad"; // ReferenceError: assignment to undeclared variable "teacher"
  topic = "math"; // ReferenceError: assignment to undeclared variable "topic"
  console.log("FFF");
}

otherClass();
```

**Scope & Function Expressions:**

Function expressions are named or anonymous functions defined within expressions. Naming functions provides benefits such as reliable self-reference, better debuggable stack traces, and more self-documenting code.

Naming benefits:
1. Reliable function self-reference.
2. Improved debuggable stack traces.
3. Enhanced self-documenting code.

Understanding scope and using meaningful function names contribute to writing clearer and more maintainable code.
