1. **Arrays in JavaScript**:
   An array is a data structure that holds an ordered collection of values. Each value is associated with an index, starting from `0`.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   let myFirstArr = ["salah", "abdalhaq"];
   ```

2. **Array Methods**:
   - `.pop()`: Removes and returns the last element of an array.
   - `.push()`: Adds elements to the end of an array.
   - `.sort()`: Sorts the elements of an array. It may not work as expected with numbers due to how sorting works for strings.
   - `.join()`: Joins the elements of an array into a single string using a specified separator.
   - `.concat()`: Combines two or more arrays.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   let myFirstArray = ["salah", "abdalhaq"];
   let last = myFirstArray.pop(); // last contains "abdalhaq"
   myFirstArray.push("abdalhaq"); // myFirstArray becomes ["salah", "abdalhaq"]
   let sortedArray = ["a", "v", "b"].sort(); // sortedArray becomes ["a", "b", "v"]
   let joinedString = ["salah", "ahmad"].join("&"); // joinedString becomes "salah&ahmad"
   let concatenatedArray = [1, 2, 3].concat([4, 5, 6]); // concatenatedArray becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   ```

3. **Mutable and Immutable Data**:
   - **Mutable Data**: Arrays are mutable, which means their elements can be modified after creation.
   - **Immutable Data**: Strings are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after creation.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   let array1 = [1, 2, 3];
   let array2 = array1;
   array1[1] = 4;
   // Now array1 is [1, 4, 3]
   // array2 is also [1, 4, 3] because they reference the same array in memory.
   ```
